June 2014 - May 2015 NuoDB Inc. Software Engineer Internship
Worked on several projects, quickly learning the requirements and able to contribute on the first day of starting said projects. Given the unique position of maintaining drivers, I was able to explore each Driver’s specific language and implementation, in depth. Allowing me to gain insightful knowledge on the Data Abstraction Layer of each language/API – and the design thereof. Was held responsible for several of the integration projects, felt amazing comfort and pride for the trust granted.
