\begin{rSubsection}{Maxwell Health ACQUIRED by Sun Life Financial, Inc}{October 2015 - October 2017}{DevOps Engineer}{Boston, MA}
\item At Maxwell I was tasked to think holistically about technology, envisioning better processes, building them, operating them, and incorporating the tools and systems that support them.
\item Pursued a kubernetes solution to break apart our monolithic design, saving roughly 288k of AWS costs and increasing deployment cycles by a factor of 8. 
\item Built out our CI/CD pipeline for Building, Testing, and Deploying our applications (docker based) on a continuous stream
\item Architected (HIPAA-Compliant) several systems (DBs, WebServers, GlusterFS as well as the underlying AWS Networking) to support our ongoing commitment to deliver our product to customers.
\item Architected an event sourcing stream with ETL for us to analyze our data, BigData related, allowed us to gain insight into our data. (Using AWS EMR - Hadoop to perform expensive computational tasks)

\begin{rSubsection}{NuoDB}{June 2014 - October 2015}{Software Engineer}{Cambridge, MA}
 \item Worked alongside the Devops, Sales Engineering, and Drivers \& Integration teams; juggling many hats. 
 	      \item Managed an enterprise level server architecture within the AWS environment, working with 
	      \\core AWS services, EC2, EBS, S3, Route53, Cloudfront, etc. 
          \item Actively worked with the NuoDB product, a distributed transactional database with an emphasis on\\ ACID compliance; applied 3rd party integrations as well as testing the feasibility and reliability\\ of such integrations
   	\item Worked on internal features; created a round-robin implementation of a failover broker feature. Greatly \\appreciated by clients and users of specific drivers. NuoDB is a scalable distributed database; thus\\ given a situation in which a specific server was down, my feature would automatically maintain a stable\\ connection to the database by using a broker, which was not down/inactive
