\begin{rSubsection}{Maxwell Health}{October 2015 - Present}{DevOps Engineer}{Boston, MA}
At Maxwell I think holistically about technology, envisioning better processes, building them, operating them, and incorporating the tools and systems that support them. A disciple of pragmatism, I engineers scalable solutions that work in the real world.
\item Built out our CI/CD pipeline for Building, Testing, and Deploying our applications (docker based) on a continuous stream
\item Architected (HIPAA-Compliant) several systems (DBs, WebServers, GlusterFS as well as the underlying AWS Networking) to support our ongoing commitment to deliver our product to customers.
\item Created and architected an event sourcing stream with ETL for us to analyze our data, BigData related, allowed us to gain insight into our data. (Using AWS EMR - Hadoop to perform expensive computational tasks

 \item Worked on maintaining NuoDB Drivers and APIs, including: PHP PDO, Node.js Driver, ODBC, JDBC, .NET Driver, Python Driver, Ruby Driver, and countless Frameworks dependent on each driver. 
	      \item Managed an enterprise level server architecture within the AWS environment, working with

          \item Actively worked with the NuoDB product, a distributed transactional database with an emphasis on\\ ACID compliance; applied 3rd party integrations as well as testing the feasibility and reliability\\ of such integrations
   	\item Worked on internal features; created a round-robin implementation of a failover broker feature. Greatly \\appreciated by clients and users of specific drivers. NuoDB is a scalable distributed database; thus\\ given a situation in which a specific server was down, my feature would automatically maintain a stable\\ connection to the database by using a broker, which was not down/inactive
          \item Created, Tested and Maintained Bamboo branch plans for Drivers. Created several build and test scripts\\ for continuous testing of the PHP-PDO driver
          \item Participated in an office move, helped with switch programming on Arista Switches; created VLANs, \\Route Tables, cabling and testing of the network
